@jpdev - most of the implementations are very simliar typeDefs - combination of Content and additional optional interfaces, often
with a few extra simple (string/int/etc) fields on top.  A few times there are more additional complex (refOne, refMany, or object) fields.
Rarely there is a field which requires a type specific resolver, but its supported.
Most are essentially a way to have a descriminated version of the content object (ContentArticle instead of Article) 
as well as Connection -(ContentArticleConnection instad of ContentConnection) for each particular content type we have.

apparatus - firehouse only.  Content + Authorable + custom elements. Apparatus data aerial, engine, tank, ec.  Uses group type for group element
article - common - Content + Authorable
blog - common - Content + Authorable
collection - just Content + 2 custom elemnts - 'displayContentType' element and 'collection' return.  What do we use this form (generic return of an array?)
company - common - Content + Addressable + SocialLinkable + Contactable + OrganizationContactable + Inquirable + PrimaryCategory
document - common - Content + Media 
ebook - ? - Content + 2 custom fields (linkText & linkUrl) - where do we use this?  Looks like external link but we have as a type as well?  Some aquisition compromise?
engine-spec - firehouse? vspc? - Content + custom fields
event - common - Content + Contactable + Addressable + custom elements and resolvers
group - Content + custom elements - called 'group' but data points indicate its meant/used as a firehouse content item.  annualBudget, munticaplity, chief - has refMany to apparatus and in-quarters types, etc.  Not sure if used anywhere else
in-quarters - firehouse only - Content + Authorable + custom elements. email, state, year, engine, earials, etc.  Don't know how it differs from group, except that it seems group can have several in-quarters and some overall parent grouping.

company - has a mess of an implementation centered around company youtube videos, pulling from google api, using the @base-cms micro package 
    which is a wrapper of a wrapper of a wrapper of a json client.  Code is in there, but disabling because it feels theres a better way
