Generally stand-alone plugable support for blocks of fields that are used in more than one content type, but NOT all content types (else would be in the overall content interface)
Most just return String/Bool/Int, there are a few additional resolvers (city/state/zip cleanu in addressable for example).
Contact type defs are used often for some interfaces (authorable linking author contacts, media linking photographer contacts, etc)

addressable - address and location info (city/state/zip/etc).  Used within Company, Conatct, etc.  All plain strings (one resolver for city/state/zip cleanup)

authorable - mainly used for authors, but also supports contributors and photographers but I've not heard of before.  All are contact references, and can take status/sort/pageination args. Authors supported on most content types:

contactable - name, phone (and variations), email (and variations), website, etc all plain Strings.  Used in Conatct, Company, etc

content - the main core conent interface supporting common elemensts across all content types

index - the wrapper include

inquirable - RMI focused.  Small, just allows to check bool status of enableRmi on an item, and has resolver to get Emails to send RMI to

media - Asset (Image) fields.  fileNmae, filePath, fileSrc resovler (how does that differ from src resolver on Asset type?).  Also contacts element pluging into the 'photographer' contact type, supporting the usual stats/sort/pagination
@jpdev - look into fileSrc here vs src in Asset - is one legacy or dreprecited, or is there a need for both?

organization-contactable - Company contacts, haven't seen used elsewhere but broken into interface here.  listingContacts, marketingContacts, salesContacts, publicContacts.  All using the same ContentContact stream and supporting same input

primary-category - adds a single field - primaryCategory pulling from mutations.Website.primaryCategory.  Not sure why this is broken out, thought it was supported on all content, perhaps because it was not fully supported, or intended to go away?

social-linkable - socialLinks support (twitter/facebook/instagram/etc) - all use same entity support (EntityStubSocial) of format provider/url/label
