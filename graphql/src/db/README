index : Used to be the local db wrapper which pulled in the db package - ultimately creates the BaseDB object which includes a MongoClient connection to the right server, and some initization work done

db: Used to be the index.js of the db package, really only includes the other 4 files from the db package and exports their methods/classes

create-basedb : pretty much just adds/setup logger to the BaseDB class

basedb : MUCH larger set of functions than just creating connections, selecting databases, collections, queries, all low level query with base4 mongo

create-mongo-client : general mongo client connection settings, rarely modified from defaults

mongodb : stock mongo base level commands

paginate : set of files standardizing how cursor, endCursor, hasNextPage, etc format is done for all respones that require pagination
